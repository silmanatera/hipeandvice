          <p>Have you ever taken an extremely awful class, pretty much the worst class in the world? The senile professor lectures unbelievably slowly, with long pauses and confusing tangents that leave your notes an endless mess. The pop quizzes aren’t even on the reading or lectures, just random facts you could never possibly know. And the Teacher’s Assistant (TA) is no help at all, consumed with their own work. Imagine getting an A in that awful class!</p>
          <p>Despite all odds, it’s possible. I know, because I did it; in fact, I ended up getting the highest grade in the class. It was a course on Chinese history, and I came into it with absolutely zero knowledge on China. I came out with a 94%. At this point, you may be wondering, “Holy crap, how did you do it?” In this article, I’ll give you seven easy steps so that you too can succeed in literally any class you take in college.</p>
          <p>I need to preface this article by saying one thing: this stems from my experience as a humanities/social sciences major. Although some of the methods for earning an A will transfer to STEM and computer science courses, I cannot guarantee that these methods will get you an A. In fact, I cannot guarantee these methods will get you an A in any class. The information in this article may improve your scores, but the key factor is personal effort. You must make the active decision to commit yourself to the work. Once you make that decision, these seven easy steps will help you succeed in all your courses.</p>
          <h2>1. DO YOUR RESEARCH</h2>
          <p>Take classes with professors that have good ratings, not classes that sound interesting. As the saying goes, a professor can make or break the class.</p>
